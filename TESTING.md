## Validation
### Python
![Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html) was used to validate all Python files. Screenshots of the results follow. I did initially encounter a number of errors in line spacing and indentation, which have been fixed. The only remaining errors, as shown below, are 
- E501 errors (line too long), all for files that were generated by Django, either from the outset or as migrations, and which I have not touched; and 
- F401 errors ('django.test.TestCase imported but not used'), one for each app I created, as Django generates these automatically.
I decided that the F401 errors were unimportant, as they involved only the import of a single model, again, automatically by Django, and I did not want to remove the test files, as I may do automated testing at a later stage. I also consider that it is safe to ignore the E501 errors, as this is the way Django generates the files for all projects, and they are not related to any code I've written or edited myself.

### JavaScript
The two JavaScript files I created for Be a Dear are slots.js (in the static folder of the be_a_dear project) and dashboard.js (in the static folder of the volunteer app). I ran these through JSHint and there are no errors. One comment occurs on each, however, regarding bootstrap--that it is an undefined variable. I believe that this is down to the fact that the linter cannot see what is in the rest of my project, such as the bootstrap script being loaded at the bottom of my templates. I decided that this comment was safe to ignore. The results are shown below.

### CSS
The project has one CSS file, located in the static folder of the be_a_dear project. It passed the ![W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) with no errors.

### HTML

### Lighthouse
Lighthouse scores were good, with accessibility and SEO scoring 100 each and performance scoring 90. 
The homepage header image was highlighted by lighthouse as not having dimensions set in the html, which can slow load times, so I resized it and gave it explicit dimensions in the html, leaving the CSS style of 100% width and auto height in place. This tipped the performance score from 89 to 90, although I understand that scores can vary slightly due to changes in underlying conditions. 
Other factors affecting performance are down to things that my project relies upon, such as render-blocking resources comprising the various CDNs I employ, such as Google Fonts, FontAwesome, JSDeliver/Bootstrap, and Heroku itself.

### Console Message
A frequent console message in all browsers was the following:

![alt text](documentation/mixed-content-console-message.png)

This is caused by Cloudinary serving the image files over http instead of https. As I understand it, there is a way to force Cloudinary delivery of messages over https, but I have not done so here. Future enhancement of the project will address this. Although less than ideal, I felt it was safe to ignore this.  According to ![MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content), there are two types of mixed content: "upgradable content" and "blockable content", and browsers should upgrade the upgradable content before rending a page. This is indeed what the above message shows is being done, as my mixed messages are of the first type, which is more benign than the second. When I ran the Heroku deployed app through ![Crawl Center's mixed content checker](https://www.crawlcenter.com/mixed-content-checker), as suggested by MDN Web Docs, I received the evaluation that no mixed content was found.

### Full front-end CRUD
Student creation of slots related to beneficiaries: 
- As a student I can create specific volunteer slots (or "tasks") linked to a beneficiary so that I can reserve the slot (i.e., save to student dashboard)
- As a student I can edit my slots so that the slots accurately reflect my volunteer work

Total time credited, total time required, and remaining time needed are summarized below the table | Pass |



## Bugs!

The default images were not being loaded for the About, Profile or Beneficiary objects.
**Fix:** Change default to "placeholder", rather than "default.jpg" or "placeholderimage.jpg", then load the relevant placeholder images conditionally in the templates.

:worried: The Slot Form (from the beneficiary detail page) was not posting correctly to the database when a user tried to edit. Although it would populate with the two first fields, it would then create a new Slot object. The reason for the bug is that I wasn't (originally) displaying all of the attributes in the rendered html template, so the javascript could not pick up all of the relevant attributes to edit. This threw errors and did not allow the javascript to run to the end of the function (where it should then change the button from "Save to Dashboard" to "Update").
**Fix:** I decided to render all of the objects attributes in the template so that they could be picked up by the javascript for editing, allowing the js function to complete, and thus allowing successful editing of the object. I considered making some of the attributes "hidden" using CSS classes, but further research revealed that javascript would not pick up any such hidden attributes. On further consideration, I thought that showing all of the attributes actually improved user experience and furthered one purpose of the project, which was to have students be able to read about what others were doing. That is, there was no harm, but to the contrary, some benefit, in rendering all of the objects attributes in the templates. As an afterthought, if I had truly wanted to hide the objects' attributes in the rendered templates, I could have simply made them display in the same font color as the background. However, I seem to recall learning that that is not good practice. So my solution in that case would be to use a different method of enabling the editing of objects, such as by using an update form, as is done from the student dashboard page. In any case, at first my solution did not work, and I discovered that I had a number of typographical errors in my javascript (in `slots.js`). Many thanks to Code Institute Tutor support for helping me identify that typo!


Errors occurred in the terminal after writing new javascript, but the errors pointed to the older javascript that had been working fine up until that point. On the student dashboard page, for which the new javascript was written, the code would not run through to complete the function relevant for that page. Those errors indicated a problem with the bootstrap delete Modal, which is used on a different page for editing slots. And on that other page, where the javascript was being used to prepopulate the form to edit a slot, an error was being thrown which referenced the javascript for the dashboard. I did not notice that second fact at first, so I was thinking that perhaps there had been some update with bootstrap that I would need to take into consideration, as the error pointed not only to my js file, but to the bootstrap script as well. But as I discussed the issue with Holly at Code Institute Tutor Support, I discovered the fact about the other webpage displaying a related (but reverse) error, and at Holly's suggestion, 
**Fix:** I split the javascript into separate files, each targeting only the relevant page or pages. Problem solved! Thank you, Holly!

Default images are not loading.

The footer is transparent except for the text, which covers content when content is scrolled.

After modifying lines of python code for the Slot model to make the lines shorter in compliance with PEP8 standards, the task-location field was being displayed on the form for updating the slot as two separate phrases with a large gap between them.
**Fix:** I removed the backslash that I had used to break the line for the string comprising the default value (on lines 55 and 56) and replaced it with ordinary quotes.

- Horizontal scrolling
**Fix** I decided to use a quick fix for this bug, as the horizontal scrolling was extremely minimal, by styling the body in CSS with overflow-x hidden.

- Last minute horror!
On what I considered the final deployed project, the delete button was not functioning on the student dashboard. I found after comparing the javascript with the html that I had accidentally deleted a class necessary for the JavaScript (written for the delete modal) to identify the button when I was restyling it for better UI. Although not a bug, at the same time I found a mislabeled aria-label ("update this task" where it should have been "delete this task" - obviously the result of a too-hurried copy and paste the failure to edit during development).
**Fix** Reinsert the necessary class for the delete button ("btn-delete-task").

Full transparency: The js file was unchanged, but I did retest, with the same passing result. I had not run the html tests yet at the time of the change.
