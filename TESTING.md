## Validation
### Python
![Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html) was used to validate all Python files. Screenshots of the results follow. I did initially encounter a number of errors in line spacing and indentation, which have been fixed. The only remaining errors, as shown below, are 
- E501 errors (line too long), all for files that were generated by Django, either from the outset or as migrations, and which I have not touched; and 
- F401 errors ('django.test.TestCase imported but not used'), one for each app I created, as Django generates these automatically.
I decided that the F401 errors were unimportant, as they involved only the import of a single model, again, automatically by Django, and I did not want to remove the test files, as I may do automated testing at a later stage. I also consider that it is safe to ignore the E501 errors, as this is the way Django generates the files for all projects, and they are not related to any code I've written or edited myself.

### JavaScript
The two JavaScript files I created for Be a Dear are slots.js (in the static folder of the be_a_dear project) and dashboard.js (in the static folder of the volunteer app). I ran these through JSHint and there are no errors. One comment occurs on each, however, regarding bootstrap--that it is an undefined variable. I believe that this is down to the fact that the linter cannot see what is in the rest of my project, such as the bootstrap script being loaded at the bottom of my templates. I decided that this comment was safe to ignore. The results are shown below.

### CSS
The project has one CSS file, located in the static folder of the be_a_dear project. It passed the ![W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) with no errors.
